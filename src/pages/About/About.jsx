      Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
      </p>

      <p>
      I am a full-stack developer specializing in the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), with a focus on creating responsive, scalable web applications. Alongside my development skills, I have experience in DevOps practices, utilizing AWS, Docker, Jenkins, and CI/CD pipelines to streamline deployment and ensure reliable performance. Feel free to check out my projects for skills validation, and Iâ€™m also open to freelance work or new opportunities.
